Invenio is a command-line tool to create and manage an [InvenioRDM](https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/) instance. Invenio is written in the Go language and an alternative to the [invenio-cli](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-cli) Python package. 

The library is under active development and basic functionality is not yet working. Expect a first working release by March 2025.
