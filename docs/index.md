Invenio is a command-line tool to create and manage an [InvenioRDM](https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/) instance. Invenio is written in the Go language and an alternative to the [invenio-cli](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-cli) Python package. 

The library is under active development and basic functionality is not yet working. Expect a first working release by March 2025. Reasons to use Invenio over invenio-cli include:

- **Performance**: Go is faster than Python.
- **Simpler Installation**: Invenio is a single binary, no need to install Python, Python packages or any other dependencies.
